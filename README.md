# LofiScript 🎧📖

LofiScript is a calm, lofi-inspired web experience that pairs ambient music with scripture verses for reflection, rest, and focus.

The goal of this project was to create a peaceful, visually comforting space while practicing responsive layout design, CSS positioning, and basic JavaScript interactivity.
